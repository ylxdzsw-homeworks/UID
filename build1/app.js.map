For example:\n\t *\n\t *                                            <Paper>\n\t *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n\t *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n\t *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n\t *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n\t *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n\t *                                            </Paper>\n\t *\n\t *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element\n\t *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n\t *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n\t *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n\t *\n\t *  <p>\n\t *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n\t *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n\t *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n\t *  </p>\n\t *\n\t *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n\t *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n\t *\n\t *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n\t *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar styles = {\n\t  box: {\n\t    boxSizing: 'border-box'\n\t  }\n\t};\n\t\n\tvar BeforeAfterWrapper = _react2.default.createClass({\n\t  displayName: 'BeforeAfterWrapper',\n\t\n\t\n\t  propTypes: {\n\t    afterElementType: _react2.default.PropTypes.string,\n\t    afterStyle: _react2.default.PropTypes.object,\n\t    beforeElementType: _react2.default.PropTypes.string,\n\t    beforeStyle: _react2.default.PropTypes.object,\n\t    children: _react2.default.PropTypes.node,\n\t    elementType: _react2.default.PropTypes.string,\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Override the inline-styles of the root element.\n\t     */\n\t    style: _react2.default.PropTypes.object\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  contextTypes: {\n\t    muiTheme: _react2.default.PropTypes.object\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  childContextTypes: {\n\t    muiTheme: _react2.default.PropTypes.object\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n\t    return {\n\t      beforeElementType: 'div',\n\t      afterElementType: 'div',\n\t      elementType: 'div'\n\t    };\n\t  },\n\t  getInitialState: function getInitialState() {\n\t    return {\n\t      muiTheme: this.context.muiTheme || (0, _getMuiTheme2.default)()\n\t    };\n\t  },\n\t  getChildContext: function getChildContext() {\n\t    return {\n\t      muiTheme: this.state.muiTheme\n\t    };\n\t  },\n\t  componentWillReceiveProps: function componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps, nextContext) {\n\t    this.setState({\n\t      muiTheme: nextContext.muiTheme || this.state.muiTheme\n\t    });\n\t  },\n\t  render: function render() {\n\t    var _props = this.props;\n\t    var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n\t    var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n\t    var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n\t    var afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n\t    var elementType = _props.elementType;\n\t\n\t    var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\t\n\t    var prepareStyles = this.state.muiTheme.prepareStyles;\n\t\n\t\n\t    var beforeElement = void 0;\n\t    var afterElement = void 0;\n\t\n\t    if (beforeStyle) {\n\t      beforeElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n\t        style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, beforeStyle)),\n\t        key: '::before'\n\t      });\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    if (afterStyle) {\n\t      afterElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n\t        style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, afterStyle)),\n\t        key: '::after'\n\t      });\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\t\n\t    var props = other;\n\t    props.style = prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, this.props.style));\n\t\n\t    return _react2.default.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n\t  }\n\t});\n\t\n\texports.default = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n/***/ },\n/* 335 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(2);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\tvar _reactDom = __webpack_require__(159);\n\t\n\tvar _reactDom2 = _interopRequireDefault(_reactDom);\n\t\n\tvar _reactEventListener = __webpack_require__(247);\n\t\n\tvar _reactEventListener2 = _interopRequireDefault(_reactEventListener);\n\t\n\tvar _renderToLayer = __webpack_require__(249);\n\t\n\tvar _renderToLayer2 = _interopRequireDefault(_renderToLayer);\n\t\n\tvar _propTypes = __webpack_require__(243);\n\t\n\tvar _propTypes2 = _interopRequireDefault(_propTypes);\n\t\n\tvar _paper = __webpack_require__(242);\n\t\n\tvar _paper2 = _interopRequireDefault(_paper);\n\t\n\tvar _lodash = __webpack_require__(336);\n\t\n\tvar _lodash2 = _interopRequireDefault(_lodash);\n\t\n\tvar _getMuiTheme = __webpack_require__(187);\n\t\n\tvar _getMuiTheme2 = _interopRequireDefault(_getMuiTheme);\n\t\n\tvar _popoverDefaultAnimation = __webpack_require__(338);\n\t\n\tvar _popoverDefaultAnimation2 = _interopRequireDefault(_popoverDefaultAnimation);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?

The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\n * Provide an options object to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on\n * the leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent calls\n * to the debounced function return the result of the last `func` invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is invoked\n * on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function is\n * invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](http://drupalmotion.com/article/debounce-and-throttle-visual-explanation)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime = 0,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxWait = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxWait = 'maxWait' in options && nativeMax(toNumber(options.maxWait) || 0, wait);\n    trailing = 'trailing' in options ?
